== Description ==
White Bracket Theme Options lets you create global content that you can then add to any page or post via shortcode. 
The shortcode is generated as soon as you save you content.

The shortcode generated will look like [wbo option_name="XXXXXX"], copy and paste the shortcode into the post or page where you would like the content you entered to be displayed.

There are currently two types of content that you can create. The first type is a standard input box, and the second type is a fully functional WYSIWYG editor.
