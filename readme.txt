== Description ==
White Bracket Theme Options lets you create global content/global options that you can then add to any page or post via shortcode. The shortcode is generated as soon as you save your content. As well as creating additional content, you can set the font size and font colour of heading tags (h1 through to h6), p tags, a tags and li tags. The latest addition to the plugin is the ability to add the latest Google Analytics code to every page on your website.

This plugin is perfect for you, if you want content to appear in multiple places across your site, such as telephone numbers, email addresses and images. Edit the content in one place, and it changes everywhere you have used the generated shortcode.

The shortcode generated will look like [wbo option_name="XXXXXX"], copy and paste the shortcode into the post or page where you would like the content you entered to be displayed.

There are currently two types of content that you can create. The first type is a standard input box, and the second type is a fully functional WYSIWYG editor.

Paragraph tags are automatically added, if you would like to disable this, you can in the shortcode by adding wpautop="no" e.g. [wbo option_name="wb_XXXX" wpautop="no"].

When you initially add a WYSIWYG editor it will add a text field, upon saving that option, it will turn into a WYSIWYG editor.

Once the plugin has been installed and is activated, you can use the plugin by going to Appearance -> Theme Options.
